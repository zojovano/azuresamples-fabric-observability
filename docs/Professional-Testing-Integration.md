# Professional .NET Testing Integration

## Single Workflow Approach âœ…

As requested, the professional .NET xUnit testing framework is now **fully integrated into the single existing GitHub Actions workflow** (`deploy-infra.yml`) without creating separate workflows.

## Workflow Structure

### ðŸš€ **Single Consolidated Pipeline:**

1. **Unit Tests** (Always runs first)
   - Fast .NET xUnit tests that validate framework and configuration
   - Runs on every push/PR to `main` branch
   - Tests the professional testing infrastructure itself
   - No Azure resources required

2. **Validation** (Conditional)
   - Bicep template validation
   - Skipped when `skip_deployment: true`

3. **Infrastructure Deployment** (Conditional)  
   - Azure resource deployment
   - Skipped when `skip_deployment: true`

4. **Fabric Artifacts** (Conditional)
   - Deploy KQL tables and Fabric workspace
   - Skipped when `skip_deployment: true`

5. **Integration Tests** (Always runs if unit tests pass)
   - Full .NET xUnit integration tests with Azure resources
   - Falls back to limited testing if deployment was skipped
   - Validates end-to-end functionality

6. **Status Report** (Always runs)
   - Comprehensive summary in GitHub Actions UI
   - Clear success/failure reporting
   - Highlights professional testing benefits

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Smart Test Execution:**
- **Pull Requests**: Runs unit tests + limited integration tests
- **Main Branch**: Runs full deployment pipeline + comprehensive tests  
- **Manual Trigger**: Option to run tests-only without deployment

### ðŸ“Š **Professional Test Reporting:**
- JUnit XML output for GitHub integration
- Code coverage reports with Coverlet
- Test result artifacts with 30-day retention
- Professional test summary in Actions UI

### ðŸ”§ **Flexible Configuration:**
- Environment-aware test settings
- Conditional execution based on deployment status
- Graceful handling of missing Azure resources
- Professional configuration management

## Benefits Over PowerShell Scripts

âœ… **Type Safety & IntelliSense**: Strong typing, compile-time validation  
âœ… **IDE Integration**: Full debugging, breakpoints, test explorer  
âœ… **Professional Reporting**: JUnit XML, coverage reports, GitHub integration  
âœ… **Maintainability**: Proper project structure, dependency management  
âœ… **CI/CD Ready**: Native GitHub Actions integration, artifact management  
âœ… **Industry Standard**: xUnit/FluentAssertions = professional testing practices  

## Trigger Conditions

```yaml
# Automatic triggers
- Push to main (when test/infra files change)
- Pull requests (when test/infra files change)

# Manual triggers  
- workflow_dispatch (with options):
  - skip_deployment: true  # Run tests only
  - location: 'region'     # Deploy to specific region
```

This single-workflow approach provides all the benefits of professional .NET testing while maintaining the simplicity you requested - no separate workflows, just one comprehensive pipeline that adapts based on the context.
